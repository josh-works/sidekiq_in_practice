# Josh's notes for this course

I'd been having trouble deciding how/where to keep written notes for this.

Since starting this course, I've dug more into Sidekiq for work at Homebot, like:

- []()
- []()

I don't plan on pushing all this data in this repo anywhere, but storing my notes in a README is perfect.

So:

```shell
$ j sidekiq
# same as cd /Users/joshthompson/personal/sidekiq_in_practice/

$ git init

$ atom .

$ cp README.md readme_original_version.md

# write this message

$ ga . # thinks "i bet nate added this repo contents to the .gitignore, because he's thoughtful like that"

$ cat .gitignore


```
